## TimedDog
An Android library which help time out app running on either background or foreground. TimedDog was 
created to solve the issues of an app not timing out after a specified time. I have come across 
many solutions on both Github and Stackoverflow but none of them work as expected due to the new constraints on
background processes in Android API 26. This library was built on   `WorkManager`, hence it would work on both apps 
targeting latest Android SDKs down to Android API 16.

### Sample

##### Modify your application class or create one if it does not exist and initialize `TimedDog` in your onCreate() method.

```java
class MyApp extends Application{
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate(){
        ...
        TimedDog.init(this);
    }
}
```

##### Extend `TimeoutActivity` in your base activity or any other activity you wants to monitor. 
```java
class BaseActivity extends TimeoutActivity{
    //...
}
```
**Suggestion:** Extends this activity on pages that can only be accessed after login.

##### Finally, start `TimedDog` in your main activity's method. Typically, this is usually the splash activity.
```java
new TimedDogXWorker.Builder(this)
      .seconds(10)
      .listener(new TimedDogXWorker.OnTimeOutListener() {
      @Override
      public void onTimeOut(boolean isForeground) {
          //Start the LOGIN ACTIVITY here.
       }
     }).build();
```

#### How To Install

##### Add the jitpack repository to your build.gradle(project level) file
```groovy
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

##### Add the library to your build.gradle(app level) file and rebuild your project
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.devmike01:TimedDog:1.0.1'
```

**That's all**
